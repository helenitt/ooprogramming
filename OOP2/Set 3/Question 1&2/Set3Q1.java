//Question 1

/*1. A composite class contains attributes which are not the usual types i.e.
 *	 String, int, float, double, boolean. It is a way of re-using code.
 *
 *	i)	private Weight startWgt; //nested object
 *		is included in the attributes, it doesn't declare the variable type
 *		because it is referenceing an object.
 *
 *	ii)	Trainee Class still compiles with public removed and the Trainee
 *		Test program runs, so it seems it can still be accessed
 *
 *	iii)Not sure what return type you would put as there is a mixture of 
 *		types and an object in there.
 *
 *	iv)	I don't think you can tell from Trainee.java whether it is an explicit
 *		no-argument constructor or a default constructor, I had to look in 
 *		Weight.java.
 *
 *	v)	No it created an exception
 *
 *	viii)Trainee.java is the owning class and Weight.java is the nested class
 *
 *	vi)	Doesn't seem to make a difference.
 *
 *	vii)Yes
