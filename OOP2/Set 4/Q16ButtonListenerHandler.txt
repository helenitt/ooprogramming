Q16	(i)	It won’t compile,  the errors are with the Container and getContentPane()  and 
		setLayout(new FlowLayout().
	(ii)	getContentPane() returns the contentPane object for this frame.
	(iii)	cPane.setLayout(new FlowLayout()); sets a flow layout so the buttons do not overlay
		each other but are placed on the screen beside each other, all being visible.
	(iv)	button.addActionListener(new ButtonListener()); sets an action listener on the 
		source object, the button, to register it with the Handler object.
	(v)	Because WindowAdapter has 7 methods so it is easier to inherit them whereas 
		ActionAdapter only has one so it doesn't make sense.  
	(vi)	If you comment out actionPerformed() it won't compile and says ButtonListener is 
		not abstract and does not override abstract method actionPerformed(ActionEvent).
		actionPerformed() is overriding the method in the interface ActionListener
		because we want it to open another dialog box. If ButtonListener did not contain
		public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {  	} it would not compile because
		the compiler would be expecting it.
	(vii)	ActionEvent belongs to the package java.awt.event
