Q5     
(i)     When you enter a name and press return the name appears in the title bar 
         saying you entered it.
(ii)    When you enter a name and press OK in the title bar it says you clicked OK.
(iii)   When you enter a name and press cancel in the title bar it says you clicked 
         cancel.
(iv)   5 GUI objects are declared. Yes.
(v)    A text field is a dialog box you can type into,  a label is text which appears 
        straight in the frame.
(vi)   ActionListener is disabled so the inputLine, your name, is not put in the menu
        bar when you hit return.
(vii)  The program still works the same when all the cpane.add(   statements are 
        put at the end of the constructor. When the order of them is changed the 
        program still works but the GUI objects are reordered also. When they are 
        put at the top of the constructor the program won't compile. This is 
        because  the objects must be created before they can be added.
(viii) It gets the source object. (e.getSource().equals(okButton)) works just as 
        well.

Q6.
(i)     Dot notation is not needed because these methods are called on an object 
        created in the main method,  setBackground() has the dot notation because 
        it is being called on the contentPane object in this constructor method.
        The title will appear in the menu bar and the background pane will be blue.
(ii)    The title will appear in the menu bar and the background pane will be blue, 
         a button is added and positioned absolutely.
