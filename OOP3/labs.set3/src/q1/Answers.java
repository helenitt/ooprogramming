/*
 *Q1
 *When the array list holds objects of different sub types polymorphism enables 
 *the appropriate toString method to be used from the correct class.
 *
 * Q2
 * Polymorphism refers to the ability of a variable, a method, or an object that 
 * has more than one form.
 * 
 * Q3
 * Dynamic Method Binding in Polymorphism is when a sub class overrides a 
 * particular method of the super class. For example, when the variable v of the 
 * type Vehicle array call the toString method in the driver class it uses the 
 * toString method from the correct one of the three sub classes depending on which 
 * object type it is.
 * 
 * Q4
 * Abstract classes contain methods which do not contain code, concrete classes
 * inherit these abstract methods and implement the code in the concrete class.
 * An abstract class can not be instantiated.
 * 
 * Q5
 * Abstract classes are usually the super classes and appear at the top of the 
 * hierarchy chart whilst the concrete classes are usually the sub classes that 
 * derive from the super classes. They appear at the bottom of the chart.
